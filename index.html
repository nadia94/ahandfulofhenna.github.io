                <h2>Hi, I'm<span> Nadia </span>, a mehndi artist.</h2><br>

                
                <p>I’ve been curating a few stories recently and would love to share them with you, so thanks for stopping by. <br> My journey started as a creative project for my Honours in Media Theory and Practice at UCT. I have used my growing skill in mehndi design to weave the stories of 8 people from very different walks of life into motifs and symbols that represent their special love stories. These are intricately traced among those characteristic of the traditional styles. 
Mehndi has traditionally been used for symbolising the love between a bride and groom on their wedding day. The ceremonial aspect behind this is what made me choose to experiment with mehndi as a narrative art form. Below you will find the stories along with explanations of the process.

         <p>From my early childhood days, I can recall having mehndi applied
to my hands and nails during a wedding period and also for Eid. Still having
small hands, which meant not a lot of space to draw, my grandmother would
apply what was known in our specific Indian culture as “lapeto”. It was
applying mehndi in a solid layer, to the inner part of your hand, from the
tips of the fingers to the bottom of the palms. This would result in a deep
orange stain, that was simple and effortless. We had a mehndi tree that grew in the front garden, so my
grandmother would “pilaar” her own mehndi whenever we needed. She would begin
the process by drying the leaves for a few days, until they were crispy and could
easily be crushed. Once they were ready, she would boil a mug of strong black
tea and pour it into the mix of crushed mehndi leaves. A paste would then
form. The paste would have to sit over a night or two, to soak up the tea and
activate the leaves. The next step was to sift the paste through a fine cloth
to get rid of the stalks and anything that would not ensure a smooth finish.</p>
<p>As I grew older, I wanted a more sophisticated hand of mehndi. My grandmother
may have known how to make the mehndi, but try as we might, we could never get
the perfect cone. And so piping out patterns onto my hand was not in the cards
until much later on when they would come directly from India. So without the
cone, my grandmother would take a needle, dip it in the paste and deposit it
bit by bit onto my hand, each addition adding to the previous one, to form the
shape of a flower. As she grew older, her patience would wear thin and it was
then up to me to draw my own flowers. But the passion didn’t last very long
and I grew out of my love for mehndi. After some years, I found an old cone in
the fridge and picked up the tradition once again. I began drawing flowers and
circles and spirals and leaves down my hand and the fascination built up
inside me. I would Google patterns to copy from, and practice on my left hand,
eagerly waiting for the previous stain to fade so that I could replace it with
a different design. As I got more and more accustomed to the design process
and application, I became quicker and more creative. That's when I took the art of mehndi
more seriously. I decided to use this opportunity to flex my creativity and challenge 
myself artistically and hence I began this project of usign mehndi as a way to tell stories. 
</p>
<p>         When I began
this project, I knew I wanted to centre it the stories on love because one of the most prominent times a woman 
gets her mehdni done is for her wedding day. This made me I think about romantic
love and so I thought about asking people to share their romantic experiences with me. <br>But then I
realised that love doesn’t fit into a box; there are so many other wonderful
kinds of love that exist.<p>This is how I came to choose my own story, which is about self-love. </p>
<p>For the past 4 years I
have lived by myself, having moved away from home to study, and through that
experience I have learnt what it truly is to appreciate your own company and
independence. I may have had to grow up quicker than some of my friends and learn 
to be respnosible in more ways than they did, but even though it was tough, the result is a rewarding one. 
I have learnt that you may be walking in a different direction to everyone else, but as long as
you are happy with where you are going, and the person you are while taking that journey, 
you will be more than OK.</p>
<p> To start my story, I included a heart on my pinky finger which
represents the love that I have for myself. The pattern flows down my hand
<br>into a display of a house, the UCT logo and a few dollar signs symbolising money. These motifs express
my journey from home to living in Cape Town and studying at UCT. The life
lessons that I learnt along the way and the financial responsibilities, as well as other responsibilities of being an adult and
taking care of myself, that I took on are represented in these as well. I ended the design with flowers as a reminder of all
the beautiful things that I have in my life, from friendships to health to
opportunities of success. And all of these things could not be be possible without me having taken my journey of self-love. </p>          </div>  <div class="col-md-12">

          <h2 class="title text-center"><span class="deco"> Garance </span> - A Journey of Love</h2>

          <p>Standing at the top of Lions Head, Garance took in the staggering
scene of the city of Cape Town below her and fell in love. With the breath-taking Table Mountain to her left, the sparkling and calming ocean
to her right, and the millions of amazing people, places and activities to do, she couldn't help but feel her heart longing. Coming from France,
she was only in Cape Town for two weeks to visit a friend, and she already knew that those two weeks would never be enough for her. She would
continue to lust after the Mother City until she could call it her second home. She glanced over the view again and still overwhelmed by her
love for this extraordinary place, she took her vows then and there. She made a promise to herself that she would come back one day and 
live here. A little while after that trip, Garance was offered the opportunity her heart had been waiting for. She was back in Cape Town within a heart beat, 
fulfilling her dreams. She gets to work as a writer during the week and as an organiser at weddings over the weekends. She spends her time indulging in
every aspect and opportunity that Cape Town has to offer, from attending parties at Shimmy Beach Club, to hiking the mountains and swimming the seas, and 
sipping her favourite wines in the Cape Winelands. With the honeymoon phase of the relationship still intoxicating her, Garance likes to call Paris her wife,
but Cape Town her lover.</p>
                       <p> To depict Garance's epic story, I began with drawing the lotus flower to represent
her. It is placed at the centre of her wrist, with the rest of the motifs surrounding it. She chose the lotus flower because she likes
to live her life with balance, zen and always puts her health first. This was made obvious to me when she asked, multiple times, if the mehndi was natural
and not filled with chemicals, because she would not want to get anything harmful into her system. The lotus flower is enveloped with Table Mountain and Lions
Head on the one side, and the Eiffel Tower on the other, representing her relationship with both Cape Town and Paris.
</p>
<p> The word L'amour, which means love, has sentimental value to her as it is a name of a street in Paris. There is also a wine glass for the 
weddings she works at on the wine farms. Garance has come a long way to find love, but now that she has, she can add falling in love with a place
to her list of different love stories.

Zannon </span> -The Love from a Friendship is Beautiful</h2> <p>Zannon has
always lived his life with the ethos of choosing love. His advice is that
whenever you are faced with any decisions in life, if you put love first then
you will invariably be making the right decision. With this in mind, Zannon relates
his story about falling in love which centres around platonic a platonic relationship. He describes the mutual
feelings that him and his friend share as being beautiful.
<p> His story began three or four months ago when he met a straight
guy and they quickly became friends. They shared a love for each other that was based purely on the
the character, personality and attributes that they gave to each other and
to those around them. Zannon thinks of his freindship as a basin of love because even though it is not
romantic, and is not based on sexual attraction, it is
something that is so special to him because he feels that it is all about one falling in love with the other
person’s inner self and not just their appearance. There is more appreciation for
what they bring into the relationship. He can honestly say that he loves his
friend and that he is sure his friend can say the same thing about him. </p>
<p>There may be different kinds of love that everyone experiences; love
towards a friend, love towards a family member, loves towards that special
someone and whatever it may be, love will always assume a big role in his
life. </p> <p>

                       In his mehndi design, I incorporated a ying-yang sign
                       that represents for him the two fold that love holds,
                       the give and take that needs each relationship should
                       have to succeed. To have the right concept of what love
                       is, and to experience its true greatness, there needs
                       to be a balance of giving and receiving. I also used
                       the symbol for friendship as a way of showing the love he has
                       for his friend. Because this plays a big role in his relationship, I have featured it twice.

<br>
 <div class="container">       <div class="row" style="width: 100%; height:auto;">              
      <div class="col-md-12">           <h2 class="title text-center"><span class="deco"> Iris </span> - Love doesn’t die</h2>

<p>Born and bred in Mexico, Iris had the dreams of travelling and writing. She
studied animation but wanted to share her passion and skill with the rest of
the world. In the middle of 2017, the doors of opportunity opened for her in
the form of a writing internship in Cape Town, and she ran to them
immediately. But as always, when one door opens, it means you have to close
one door behind you, and for Iris, it was the door to her relationship with
her boyfriend of six and a half years. They had both decided that moving away
from home, it would be best to take a break from their relationship. </p>
<p>Having been away from Mexico for five months now, Iris and her boyfriend still share
a love for each other. It may not be a romantic one anymore, but they are
still there for each other when they need to be. They continue to care and
support each other, demonstrating that love isn’t something that just dies. It
doesn’t disappear into the distance that may float between the two hearts. She
shared this sentiment when she mentioned that her ex had a bouquet of proteas
delivered to her office on her first day there, to commemorate Iris on living
out her dreams. They still spend hours talking on the phone, sharing all the
details of the current events in their respective continents.  phone and
updating each other on current events in their separate continents. And
whatever it comes down to, they always wish each other the best of everything.
“He was the guy I could imagine marrying, but even if he ended up with another
girl and marrying her, I would honestly wish him the best. All I want for him
is for him to be happy.”  </p>                      
  <p> Iris's design
includes lots of flowers that centre around the happiness and tenderness that
is still evident in her relationship with her ex. These flowers relate to the happiness that
both of them want for each other. The pattern then progresses to little
motifs that encircle one of the flowers on the back of her palm. A house and a protea are enveloped by
the South African flag and the Mexican flag, a tribute to her journey.
The house represents the journey Iris took in leaving her home in Mexico and coming to live here in Cape Town while the
protea is for the bouquet she received from her ex on her first day of work. The fingers end off the design and 
conclude her story with a few traditional
motifs </p>

<!-- this is Leandre's story -->
<br>
<br>

<div class="container">       <div class="row" style="width: 100%; height:
auto;">                   <div class="col-md-12">           <h2 class="title
text-center"><span class="deco"> Leandre </span> - Faithful love</h2> <p>The
Having sat down with Leandre, she reminded me of another love that is often excluded from
the conversation, and that is the love one has for their religion
and God. Her eyes sparkling and her smile widening, she described what love meant to 
her as the unconditional and overwhelming feeling you get inside of you when you possess
a love for someone or sometihng. It needn't matter if it be intangible or physically invisible, your love can 
still be strong.
<p> For Leandre, personally, it's about giving love to
your family, friends and those closest to you without holding back. She emphasises about
creating and sharing happiness with the ones you love, because at the end of it all, everyone wants
to, and deserves to be happy. But the biggest part of sharing love for her encompasses God
and having faith. As a firm believer in Christianity, she says that her values are instilled in her and that is why her love for
her beliefs is so important to her.  </p>

                       In her mehndi design, I incorporated an anchor as an
                       allegory for the role her parents play in her life. The peace sign and tree of life are demonstrative of the balance and positive energies that she focuses on to keep her life and love grounded.
                       I also integrated a cross because her religion and beliefs play a big role in everything she does, as well as her love for God being so great.
                       included a heart that covers quite a bit of her hand
                       because I wanted it to represent the idea that for her,
                       love means everything, so it symbolises the magnitude
                       that it plays in her life.

                    <p>A hiking lover and outdoorsy person at heart, it is no
wonder that Shauntel met the love of her life on a weekend of adventure and
sport. She was introduced to her now fiancé through a mutual hobby of sailing.
Their story began when she walked into the room, making eye contact with
Michael and feeling an instant connection. There were lots of smiles going
around while they sat and played coy, flirting over a cup of coffee, something
which Michael never indulges in except he did on that day. The two days passed
in so much entrancement that Shauntel had forgotten to give Michael her
number. After having to jump through a few hoops with their captains to try
and organise contact details they were finally on the right path.
<p> I began Shauntel's desgin with a few sail boats sailing down towards her wrist. Because this was a major aspect of her story it took up a large portion of her design. 
     The flowers represent the good and beautiful things in her life, including her relationship with her finace. On each finger, I drew a motif. The pinky finger
     has a coffee cup, because on the day she met Michael, he was sipping on coffee, something he never has. The ring finger has a game controller which represents Michael himself
     and it was strategically placed on this finger to further symbolise their union. The middle finger and index finger have an ice cream cone and putt putt respectively 
     to dictate how they spent their Friday nights getting to know each other.

Maxine </span> - A love that dreams are made of</h2>
<p>For Maxine, love means to love unconditionally. love for yourself The love between a parent
and child is what means the most to her, so it is no surprise that her love
story centres around her and her daughter, Tiffany. Having raised her as a
single mother after her husband passed away when Tiffany was still young,
Maxine shares a special bond with her daughter. Soon after she was born, the
first time maxine heard her, she knew that it was her. Despite there being so
many other babies in the nursery, she could only hear her. She says that a
mother waits to hear the first cry of their baby, and from then on you go
through everything together with them.                         <p>  I began the design with a dream catcher, because dreams form a big part of the relationship she has with Tiffany.
The pattern progresses up her hand towards her fingers with some traditonal leaf designs and the mother and child motif. This demonstrates Maxine holding her daughter in 
her embrace, a sign of the enduring bond between them. On her index finger is the Zumba logo, because Zumba and dance plays a big part of, as she describes "keeping her sane".

                       <p>A mother to two beautiful daughters, Shamema has a single word that means everything to her, and that is family. Breaking down at the mere mention of them displays the depths her heart will go. As she wiped the tears off her cheeks and smiles while questioning why she always cries at moments like these, she describes the love between a parent and a child as being unconditional. And that is why her story revolves around sharing this bond. being so close to her daughters and sharing with them as they grow up is what keeps their love alive. There’s nothing she would have any other way.


                        <p> In Shamema’s pattern, I weaved the mother and baby symbol to represent both her daughters in their mother’s embrace. 
                        I did two of these symbols, one on either side of the traditional pattern to stand is as each daughter. I also used a heart with a smaller heart to demonstrate the love that she has for each daughter. At the end of the patter, towards the wrist, I incorporated a leaf with tear drops falling as a way of symbolising her emotions when she spoke about her love for her children.

                       <p>Love is a very broad concept, as Louise found out over the years. She realises that it is not like she used to think it was, where it would just be about one person or nothing. Now, it means something that is in her heart, a feeling that makes it expand. Love can be towards a friend. It can be a relationship with her family or her partner. It can even be a beautiful sunset or someone who has just done something wonderful. The first thing that comes to her mind when speaking about love is the all encompassing love of a mother. Having lost hers when she was 9, her father remarried to, as Louise describes her, “the most wonderful, wonderful woman in the world.” And for Louise, she is everything that one could want in a mother or a friend. So for her, no matter where she is or what she is, how ever long she lives, this will be her lasting memory of someone who is absolutely amazing. 
                        <p> For Louise I drew a cat peeping out from surrounding flowers. She says that the cat well represents her mother seeing as she loves cats. I included it among the flowers to demonstrate the vastness of love that Louise and her mother share. And as with the other patterns, the flowers also represent everything that is beautiful in her life. I added a heart to the top of the design as a way of reiterating the love.
