                <h2>Hi, I am<span> Nadia </span> a mehndi artist.</h2><br>
                <p>I’ve been curating a few stories recently and would love to share them with you, so thanks for stopping by. <br> My journey started as a creative project for my Honours in Media Theory and Practice at UCT. I have used my skill in mehndi design to weave the stories of 8 people from very different walks of life into motifs and symbols that represent their special love stories. These are intricately traced among those characteristic of the traditional styles. 
Mehndi has traditionally been used for symbolising the love between a bride and groom on their wedding day. The ceremonial aspect behind this is what made me choose to experiment with mehndi as a narrative art form. Below you will find the stories along with explanations of the process.

         <p>When I began this project, I knew I wanted to centre it on love. I thought about
romantic love and asking people to share their experiences with me,
<br>but then I realised that love doesn’t fit into a box, there are so many other wonderful kinds of
love that exist. My story is about self-love. For the past 4 years I have lived by myself, having
moved away from home to study and through that experience I have learnt what it truly is to
appreciate your own company and independence. To start my design, I included a heart on my pinky
finger which represents the love that I have for myself. The pattern flows down my hand <br>into a
display of a house, the UCT logo, symbols of money. These express my journey from home to living in
Cape Town and studying at UCT. The life lessons <br>I learnt along the way and the financial
responsibilities that I took on and understood. I ended the design with flowers as a reminder of all
the beautiful things that I have in my life, from friendships to health to opportunities of success.

          <p>Standing at the top of Lions Head, Garance took in the staggering scene of the city of Cape Town below her and fell in love. Coming from France, she was only in Cape Town for two weeks to visit a friend, but so vast was her love for this extraordinary place that she took her vows then and there, promising that she would come back one day and live here. As soon as the opportunity presented itself, she was back in a heartbeat. Now that she is fulfilling her dreams, she likes to say that Paris is her wife but Cape Town her lover.
                        <br> I used the lotus flower to represent Garance because she likes to be centred and zen and healthy lifestyle. On the one side is table mountain and lions head while on the other is the Eiffel Tower then there is a road name she wanted and a wine glass because she helps organise weddings on the wine farms as a part time job which ties to her love for Cape Town and falling for it.

                       <p>Having met a straight guy about 3 or 4 months ago, Zannon and he really fell in love with each other in the sense of friendship. He honestly can say that he fell in love with his friend and his friend could say the same. Its a special kind of love because its one that doesn’t need physical attraction, but is based on loving the character, attributes that they give to you and to other people that makes you love them. There may be different kinds of love that everyone experiences; love towards a friend, love towards a family member, loves towards that special someone and whatever it may be, Zannon lives his life with the ethos of choosing love. If ever faced with a tough decision in your life, choose love, and things will work out. <br>

                       In his mehndi design, I incorporated a ying-yang sign that represents for him the two fold that love holds, the give and take that needs to happen. To have the right concept of what love is, and to experience its true greatness, there needs to be a balance of giving and receiving. I also used the symbol for friendship as a way of showing his love for his friend.

                       <p>Having met a straight guy about 3 or 4 months ago, Zannon and he really fell in love with each other in the sense of friendship. He honestly can say that he fell in love with his friend and his friend could say the same. Its a special kind of love because its one that doesn’t need physical attraction, but is based on loving the character, attributes that they give to you and to other people that makes you love them. There may be different kinds of love that everyone experiences; love towards a friend, love towards a family member, loves towards that special someone and whatever it may be, Zannon lives his life with the ethos of choosing love. If ever faced with a tough decision in your life, choose love, and things will work out. <br>

                       In his mehndi design, I incorporated a ying-yang sign that represents for him the two fold that love holds, the give and take that needs to happen. To have the right concept of what love is, and to experience its true greatness, there needs to be a balance of giving and receiving. I also used the symbol for friendship as a way of showing his love for his friend.

                    <p>A hiking lover and outdoorsy person at heart, it is no wonder that Shauntel met the love of her life on a weekend of adventure and sport. She was introduced to her now fiancé through a mutual hobby of sailing. Their story began when she walked into the room, making eye contact with Michael and feeling an instant connection. There were lots of smiles going around while they sat and played coy, flirting over a cup of coffee, something which Michael never indulges in except he did on that day. The two days passed in so much entrancement that Shauntel had forgotten to give Michael her number. After having to jump through a few hoops with their captains to try and organise contact details they were finally on the right path.
                        <br> I used the lotus flower to represent Garance because she likes to be centred and zen and healthy lifestyle. On the one side is table mountain and lions head while on the other is the Eiffel Tower then there is a road name she wanted and a wine glass because she helps organise weddings on the wine farms as a part time job which ties to her love for Cape Town and falling for it.

                       <p>For Maxine, love means to love unconditionally. The love between a parent and child is what means the most to her, so it is no surprise that her love story centres around her and her daughter, Tiffany. Having raised her as a single mother after her husband passed away when Tiffany was still young, Maxine shares a special bond with her daughter. Soon after she was born, the first time maxine heard her, she knew that it was her. Despite there being so many other babies in the nursery, she could only hear her. She says that a mother waits to hear the first cry of their baby, and from then on you go through everything together with them.
                        <br> I used the lotus flower to represent Garance because she likes to be centred and zen and healthy lifestyle. On the one side is table mountain and lions head while on the other is the Eiffel Tower then there is a road name she wanted and a wine glass because she helps organise weddings on the wine farms as a part time job which ties to her love for Cape Town and falling for it.

<!-- this is Shamema's story -->

          <h2 class="title text-center"><span class="deco"> Shamema</span> - Family is worth every tear</h2>
                       <p>A mother to two beautiful daughters, Shamema has a single word that means everything to her, and that is family. Breaking down at the mere mention of them displays the depths her heart will go. As she wiped the tears off her cheeks and smiles while questioning why she always cries at moments like these, she describes the love between a parent and a child as being unconditional. And that is why her story revolves around sharing this bond. being so close to her daughters and sharing with them as they grow up is what keeps their love alive. There’s nothing she would have any other way.


                        <br> In Shamema’s pattern, I weaved the mother and baby symbol to represent both her daughters in their mother’s embrace. 
                        I did two of these symbols, one on either side of the traditional pattern to stand is as each daughter. I also used a heart with a smaller heart to demonstrate the love that she has for each daughter. At the end of the patter, towards the wrist, I incorporated a leaf with tear drops falling as a way of symbolising her emotions when she spoke about her love for her children.

<!-- this is Louise's story -->

        <div class="col-md-12">
          <h2 class="title text-center"><span class="deco"> Louise </span> - A mother's love is all encompassing</h2>
                       <p>Love is a very broad concept, as Louise found out over the years. She realises that it is not like she used to think it was, where it would just be about one person or nothing. Now, it means something that is in her heart, a feeling that makes it expand. Love can be towards a friend. It can be a relationship with her family or her partner. It can even be a beautiful sunset or someone who has just done something wonderful. The first thing that comes to her mind when speaking about love is the all encompassing love of a mother. Having lost hers when she was 14, her father remarried to, as Louise describes her, “the most wonderful, wonderful woman in the world.” And for Louise, she is everything that one could want in a mother or a friend. So for her, no matter where she is or what she is, how ever long she lives, this will be her lasting memory of someone who is absolutely amazing. 
                        <br> For Louise I drew a cat peeping out from surrounding flowers. She says that the cat well represents her mother seeing as she loves cats. I included it among the flowers to demonstrate the vastness of love that Louise and her mother share. And as with the other patterns, the flowers also represent everything that is beautiful in her life. I added a heart to the top of the design as a way of reiterating the love.
